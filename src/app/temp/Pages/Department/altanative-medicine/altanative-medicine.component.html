        <p>
          Traditional and Alternative Medicine (TAM) has been practiced in Zanzibar for years without official guidelines. However, there has been growing public awareness about the potential benefits of TAM to the health sector. With the formulation of this policy, the Ministry of Health aims to guide TAM practice, enhance its benefits, and ensure sustainable use of resources. The policy also outlines the role of TAM in Zanzibar’s healthcare system and establishes a framework for the development and regulation of TAM practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The policy encourages cooperation between stakeholders to ensure the proper use of natural resources, the protection of indigenous knowledge, and the promotion of sustainable environmental practices. By integrating TAM into the national healthcare system, Zanzibar aims to offer better healthcare and improve the overall health of its people.
