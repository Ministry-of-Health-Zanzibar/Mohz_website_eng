          The LMU became fully operational in January 2016. However, due to additional functions in the Chief Pharmacist Office (CPO) related to Policy and Practice, Quality Management, Resource Planning, and Finance, a suggestion was made to rename the LMU to the Supply Chain Management Unit (SCMU). This name change was approved at the 20th ZLTWG meeting.
