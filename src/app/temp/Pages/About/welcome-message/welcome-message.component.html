            The Ministry of Health Zanzibar oversees all health-related issues in Zanzibar. In the early '90s, the Ministry embarked on a fully-fledged reform process in 2002. The Strategic Plan for the Health Sector (ZHSRSP I) 2002/03-2006/7 which was followed by ZHSRSP II 2006/7 - 2010/11 was developed based on the 1999 Zanzibar Health Policy.

            The change sought to expand planning, prioritize, and integrate health care at the district level. In addition, the amendment was intended to ensure access to high-quality care for all Zanzibaris with a prioritized illness or burden of disease and in line with the required Health Care Package.
