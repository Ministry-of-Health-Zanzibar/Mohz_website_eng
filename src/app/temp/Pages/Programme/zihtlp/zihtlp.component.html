        <p>
          The first cases of AIDS in Zanzibar were diagnosed in 1986, with the HIV epidemic initially being low. Zanzibar faces a concentrated HIV epidemic, predominantly among sex workers, drug users, and men who have sex with men, with rates of 19%, 11.3%, and 2.6%, respectively, as per the 2012 Bio-Behavioral study.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, an estimated 6,269 individuals (adults and children) were living with HIV, with 81% of them in the 15-49 age group.

          Tuberculosis continues to be a major public health challenge in Zanzibar, with reported cases rising from 354 in 2005 to 855 in 2015. The 25-34-year age group is most affected, with men being more vulnerable than women.

        <p>
          The goal of leprosy control is to prevent disabilities through early detection and treatment. Zanzibar has seen a decrease in diagnosed leprosy cases, with only 104 cases reported in 2015, down from 177 in 2014. Zanzibar, however, still has high levels of leprosy in some districts, with South, Urban, and West districts showing the highest burden.
